This repo contains my work for Create Python Gitlab Template assignment of IDS 706. If you want to use this just add this to the codespace of github and wait for the devcontainer to execute the Makefile that execute the following: install, format, lint, test.

This is a very simple project that includes a main.py file that has a function called print_custom_message(name, year, month, day) that takes as input a Name and a birthday. Then return the age of the input in years and months
