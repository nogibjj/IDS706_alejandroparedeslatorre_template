This repo contains my work for Create Python Gitlab Template assignment of IDS 706. If you want to use this just refer this to a codespace in github and wait for the devcontainer to execute the Makefile that execute the following: install, format, lint, test.

According to the requirement it gets added

* `Makefile`

* `Dockerfile`

* `devcontainer`

* `requirements.txt` with a set of specifications

* `githubactions` 

* `.devcontainer` for Githubcodespace 

## Purpose of project
The purpose of this project is to have a python template that includes a main.py file that has only one function called print_custom_message(name, year, month, day) that takes as input a Name and a birthday split as year, month and day of birthday. This function returns the age of the input in years and months specified in the main part of the file. I test this function with the help of the file test_main.py

## Preparation
1. open codespaces 
2. load repo to code spaces
2. Wait for the installation of all the requirements in requirements.txt
